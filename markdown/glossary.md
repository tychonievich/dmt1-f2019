Associative
:   Of an operator, meaning the order of operations when several of that operator are applied in a row does not matter.
    To say some operator $\cdot$ is associative means that $(P \cdot Q) \cdot R \equiv P \cdot (Q \cdot R)$ for all propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$.

Commutative
:   Of an operator, meaning the order of its operands does not matter.
    To say some operator $\cdot$ is commutative means that $P \cdot Q \equiv Q \cdot P$ for all propositions $P$ and $Q$.

Conjunction
:   Logical AND ($\land$).

Contradiction
:   A logical expression that is equivalent to FALSE ($\bot$).

De Morgan's laws
:   Two specific, related logical equivalences; see our [list of equivalences](axioms.html#equivalences) for their form.
    
    Because of their related structure, it is not uncommon to refer to both together in the singular (i.e. "De Morgan's law").

Disjunction
:   Logical OR ($\lor$).

Equivalent
:   Two logical expressions $P$ and $Q$ are equivalent if and only if the expression $P \leftrightarrow Q$ is a tautology.

Formula
:   see *Logical Expression*.

Iff
:   A contraction of "if and only if", a linguistic word for a bi-implication

Logical Expression
:   One or more propositions or predicates, combined with operators so that the whole is a predicate or proposition.

Proposition
:   A statement that, by construction, must either be true or false.

Satisfiable
:   A satisfiable expression is not a contradiction.

Sentence
:   see *Logical Expression*.

Tautology
:   A logical expression that is equivalent to TRUE ($\top$).

Valid
:   A valid expression is a tautology.
